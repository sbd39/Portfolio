# Portfolio
A showcase of some of the scripts I have create, maintained, or modified.

This repository is for showcaseing some of the source code for projects I have worked on. I may display code that I did not originally create, but that I modified or changed in some substaintial way. The code stored in this repository is not ment to be used in any capacity. It is meant to showcase my programming ability to prospective employeers. For now this repository will mainly be showing code from my senior project, Circuit Breaker, and I may or may not update this repository with future projects or past projects that I'm particularly proud of.
